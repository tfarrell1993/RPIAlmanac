				<h2 class="section-heading">Summary</h2>
                <p>RPI Almanac is a mobile application designed to be a user generated encyclopedia of various buildings and important locations around RPI’s campus. Users are able to interact with a map focused on their current location. The map will display various colored pins on buildings where each color represents a particular category of building such as food, academic, etc. Each pin will hold information about that particular building including the name, address, hours of operation, as well as user ratings and reviews. All content about a particular pin is user generated and therefore dependent on users to contribute information. When users submit the content, it is approved by the developer team and then rated by the user community. Because RPI Almanac utilizes user contributions to gather information about landmarks in the area, there is really no restriction on what kind of information this app can provide. Users have the ability to add anything from a funny story to historical facts about any building they wish. This application has a lot of potential for expansion because this could easily be applied to other colleges and universities with little to no changes to the software.</p>
				<h2 class="section-heading">Business Case</h2>
                <p>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute android application is an app currently on the google play store created by the institute itself. This app allows students to sign in using his or her RPI ID and offers specific information for that students such as a schedule, grades, and a course catalog. The app also offers a campus calendar, a feed from the institutes social media accounts, a directory, as well as a campus map. The campus map is the main competition since RPI Almanac is focused on an interactive map for users. The campus map in the institute’s application simply shows a map of RPI’s campus with a pin on each building. The user can click these pins and it will display the name of the building and what campus it is on, which for our application would be Troy.</p>
				<p>RPI Almanac may be based on the same map idea, but our application would be preferred by users because it allows for more interaction similar to that of a social media platform. Instead of being a rigid map only including the names of campus buildings, RPI Almanac will offer a flow of creative user generated information about any building in the area thus drawing more users to our application as well as keeping users in our application and interacting for extended periods of time.</p>
				<p>RPI mobile is another similar android application with a slightly different campus map design. The campus map in this app initially displays a list of all buildings on RPI’s campus. After selecting a building, the map will open with a pin dropped on that location. Unlike the institute’s application, RPI mobile does not display the campus map with all pins in it’s entirety and instead only displays one at a time.</p>
				<p>RPI mobile differs from RPI Almanac in the same way as the previous one does. Our application offers a much richer user experience and would be preferred by users as their main source of campus map information.</p>
