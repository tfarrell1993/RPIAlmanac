RPIAlmanac
==========

RPI Almanac is a mobile application designed to be a user generated encyclopedia of various buildings and important locations around RPIâ€™s campus. Users are able to interact with a map focused on their current location. The map will display various colored pins on buildings where each color represents a particular category of building such as food, academic, etc. Each pin will hold information about that particular building including the name, address, hours of operation, as well as user ratings and reviews. All content about a particular pin is user generated and therefore dependent on users to contribute information. Because RPI Almanac utilizes user contributions to gather information about landmarks in the area, there is really no restriction on what kind of information this app can provide. Users have the ability to add anything from a funny story to historical facts about any building they wish. This application has a lot of potential for expansion and could easily be applied to other colleges and universities with little to no changes to the software.
